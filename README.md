`progress_bar.py` contains a progress bar that can easily be included in other projects (useful in loops).  
The output is printed to the console, in Pycharm the debug console shows you the same result as if you run the code with "Emulate terminal in output console" option checked in Run/Debug Configuration.  
`unibe.py` contains the HEX codes of the colors that match the corporate design of the University of Bern/City of Bern. This is useful to create nice plots.
